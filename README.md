# 20q [NOW DEPRECTATED]

A web client for the Haaretz trivia quizzes.

## Deprecation

Haaretz changed their website and now I can't crawl it to get the quiz
information. I kept the database and website for posterity and in case this
becomes possible again in the future. Oh well.

## Features

It's very similar to their web client and app version, but it has three major improvements, two of which are relevant for most people:

1. You can grade half points (for those tricky questions when you know that Kiryat Ono has a sister city in the Netherlands, but you're just not sure which one.
2. It doesn't hide the answers for questions you've already answered
